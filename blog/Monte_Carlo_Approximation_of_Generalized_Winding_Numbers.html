    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        Generalized Winding Numbers (GWNs) are really useful for determining if a point is inside a polygon and various
        other
        uses, however, calculating exact GWN values has O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity. This article presents a Monte
        Carlo method for approximating GWN values in O(log(n)) time.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>O(n<sup>2</sup>) method for calculating GWN</h3>
    <p>
        In R<sup>2</sup>, the GWN of a point <i>p</i> with respect to a polygon <i>P</i> is defined as the sum of the
        signed angles at the point for every triangle that is formed using the point and every edge in the polygon (edge
        direction matters).
    </p>
    <p>
        In R<sup>3</sup>, solid angles at the point for every tetrahedron that is formed using the point and every
        triangle of the mesh are summed instead, in this case the winding order of the vertices of every one of those
        triangles matter.
    </p>
    <h3>Alternative methods for calculating GWN in 2D and 3D for closed surfaces</h3>
    <h3>There are two main methods:</h3>
    <h3>The even-odd rule</h3>
    <p>
        In the even-odd rule method, we intersect a ray from the
        query point into the mesh and counts the number of intersections, if the number of intersections is odd, then we
        consider the point to be inside the mesh, if it is even, then we consider the point to be outside.
    </p>
    <h3>The non-zero rule</h3>
    <p>
        In the non-zero rule, the winding order of mesh or polygon matters, because we intersect a ray from the query
        point, and at every intersection, we compare the direction of the ray with the direction of the normal of the
        edge, if mesh is 2D, or triangle if mesh is 3D, if those two directions have a positive dot product, then we
        give this intersection a value of +1, if the dot product is negative, we give the intersection a value of -1,
        summing all the
        intersection values results in either a zero sum or a non-zero sum, points that have a non-zero sum are
        considered to be inside the mesh, otherwise they are considered to be outside.
